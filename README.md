# Advent of Code 2023
I am currently learning C++ and decided to do the Advent of Code challenges in C++. 
For more Infos checkout https://adventofcode.com/

## Overview
The Solutions are written in C++. To compile a corresponding cpp file use 
```
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -g -o solution.o solution.cpp
```
The Input Files have to be in the folder of the corresponding day. Code execution will fail otherwise.
